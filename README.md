Christmas beer rating application

This is a web application written in perl Dancer2 to aid with the rating of Christmas beer (or other beers for that matter).

To set up, you will need the prereqs listed in `Makefile.PL`. You also need to set up `environments/development.yml` 
and probably also `environments/production.yml`. See example for MySQL in the `examples` folder

To start up for development, simply start `public/dispatch.cgi` and a build in web server running on port 5000 will start up
